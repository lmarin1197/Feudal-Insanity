## Problems/Hurdles
Getting the audio to work properly was a major issue, as there is some audio autoplay restrictions with chrome.
Having everything scale with size (could not figure out completely)

## tip: 
click the skull on the titlescreen for some ambience once you click "YOUR JOURNEY", 
you will be redirected to the "battlefield" where you can choose to 
either heal yourself or attack the enemy 

## installation instructions:
No installation required.

## What's To Come
What's next:
-Have multiple enemies which differ in size and appearance
-Create a shop in between waves where you can spend gold on items
-Add additional worlds with their own enemies
-Add an optional boss every x amount of waves that can give rare loot
-Add a level/skill system
-Add multiple "classes" (Mage, Archer, warrior etc.)
-Add multiple attributes for armor (strength, agility, luck, etc.)
